# Demo

This is a simple demo of a few ways django template functionality can be used for translations when the built in localization is not quite what is needed.

### How To Run
* Install docker ce from https://www.docker.com/get-started
* Clone this repository to your local computer

From the command line in the directory you cloned the code to:
* `make build-image`
* `make run`

From there the site should be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000/`
