<h2>Via a Template Tag</h2>
<p>
    This is some simple, untranslated, page specific content and layout to show that there is no need to duplicate
    layout. This appears before the translated text.  Here we use a custom template tag to merge include and the view/inheritance like behavior.

{% include_trans 'via_includes/index.html' %}

    And this appears after the translated text.
